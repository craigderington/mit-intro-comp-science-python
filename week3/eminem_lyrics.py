lyrics = "Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings But I am only going to get this one chance Somethings wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you are on) \
Just a feeling I have got, like somethings about to happen, but I do not know what \
If that means, what I think it means, we are in trouble, big trouble, \
And if he is as bananas as you say, I am not taking any chances \
You were just what the doctor ordered."
